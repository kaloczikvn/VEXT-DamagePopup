# VEXT-DamagePopup

Adds damage text popups when the local player damages another player.

This mod is made for Venice Unleashed!

Heavily inspired by [kapraran's fortnite-hit-effects](https://github.com/kapraran/vu-mods/tree/master/fortnite-hit-effects)

## Issues
- No FOV sync between Three.JS and VU
- The camera rotation is a bit weird...
